# Tic_Tac_Toe
A Tic-Tac-Toe app wherein the user plays the computer. It is written in plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. The app allows the user to choose X's or O's, the option to reset during the game, automatic reset after a game over/results viewing period, and the computer playing against the user "smartly" via AI. The AI is implemented using a light variation of the minimax algorithm theory. There is a slight flaw in the AI that allows for a particular move to beat the computer, and sometimes preventing the computer acting aggressively to pursue a win, assuming the user may not always make an ideal set of moves. These are being corrected.
